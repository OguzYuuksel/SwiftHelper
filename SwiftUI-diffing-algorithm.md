#### Primitive Views
Primitive views are not defined in terms of other views. (`Text`, `Button`, `Color`, `Shape`, `Image`, `List`, `VStack`, `HStack`)

#### Composed Views
As clients of the SwiftUI framework, we can only create composed views. 
Composed views can have state, and can be seen as a function of this state to another view. 
Composed views use primitive views in their body. Primitive views are the building blocks of any type of view.
(`ContentView`)
